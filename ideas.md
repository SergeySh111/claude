  <design_movement>Neumorphism 2.0 (Soft UI + Glassmorphism)</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Tactile Softness**: Elements should feel like they are extruded from the background or floating just above it with soft, realistic shadows.
    2. **Translucent Layering**: Use frosted glass effects (backdrop-blur) for overlays and sticky headers to create depth without harsh borders.
    3. **Data as Art**: Charts and progress bars should be vibrant and glowing, contrasting against the soft, neutral background.
    4. **Fluidity**: Interactions should be gentle and fluid, mimicking physical material properties.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Ethereal Clarity"**: A base of off-white or very light cool grey (#F0F4F8) to allow shadows to pop. Accents are vivid, neon-like gradients (Teal to Blue, Purple to Pink) to represent the "digital" nature of marketing data. The goal is to make complex data feel approachable and calm, reducing cognitive load.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **"Floating Dashboard"**: Instead of a rigid grid, use a masonry-style or modular layout where cards "float" in space. The header blends into the background, and the main content area is a slightly elevated plane.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Soft-Shadow Cards**: Cards with double shadows (light top-left, dark bottom-right) to create the extruded look.
    2. **Glowing Data Points**: KPI numbers and chart lines have a subtle outer glow.
    3. **Pill-Shaped Inputs**: Search bars and filters are fully rounded (stadium shape) with inner shadows.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Press and Release"**: Buttons and cards depress (inset shadow) when clicked, providing satisfying tactile feedback. Hover states lift elements slightly.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **"Drift and Settle"**: Elements enter with a slow, smooth fade-up. Hover effects have a springy, non-linear ease.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: *Nunito* (Rounded sans-serif) for a friendly, approachable vibe.
    **Body/Data**: *JetBrains Mono* or *Roboto Mono* for numbers and tabular data to emphasize precision.

  <design_movement>Cyberpunk / High-Tech HUD</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Information Density**: Embrace the complexity. Show data with precision, using thin lines and technical markers.
    2. **High Contrast**: Dark mode default. Deep blacks/greys with neon accents (Cyan, Magenta, Lime).
    3. **Grid & Structure**: Visible grid lines, corner brackets, and monospaced decorative elements.
    4. **Glitch & Tech**: Subtle glitch effects on interaction, scanning lines, and digital noise textures.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Data Stream"**: Deep void background (#050505). Primary accent is "Electric Cyan" (#00F0FF) for positive metrics, "Laser Pink" (#FF0099) for alerts. Text is stark white or cool grey. This evokes a sense of advanced analytics and cutting-edge technology.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **"Command Center"**: A strict, dense grid. The screen is framed by a "HUD" border. Panels are separated by thin, glowing lines rather than whitespace.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Corner Brackets**: Every card or section has decorative brackets `[ ]` or `L` shapes at the corners.
    2. **Scanlines**: A subtle overlay of horizontal scanlines on the background or specific data visualizations.
    3. **Monospaced Everything**: Even headers use a technical, monospaced font or a wide, geometric sans.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Instant Response"**: No soft fades. Hover states snap instantly. Buttons flash when clicked. It feels like a high-performance terminal.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **"Decode and Slide"**: Text "decodes" (random characters resolving to final text) on load. Panels slide in from the edges with a mechanical ease.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: *Orbitron* or *Rajdhani* (Squared, futuristic).
    **Body/Data**: *Share Tech Mono* or *Fira Code*.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) Modernized</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Objective Clarity**: Content is king. No decorative shadows or textures. Pure geometry and typography.
    2. **Asymmetric Balance**: Use a strong grid but balance elements asymmetrically to create dynamic tension.
    3. **Bold Typography**: Large, heavy sans-serif headings used as graphical elements.
    4. **Vibrant Flat Color**: Large blocks of solid, high-saturation color to categorize information.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Bauhaus Primary"**: Stark White background (#FFFFFF) or very light grey. Text is absolute Black (#000000). Accents are pure, unadulterated Red (#FF3B30), Blue (#007AFF), and Yellow (#FFCC00). This communicates honesty, boldness, and structural integrity.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **"Modular Grid"**: A strict multi-column grid. Elements span specific column counts. White space is used rigidly to separate modules.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Thick Dividers**: Heavy black lines (2px-4px) separating sections.
    2. **Oversized Type**: KPI numbers are massive, taking up 50% of their container.
    3. **Geometric Badges**: Categories are indicated by simple geometric shapes (circle, square, triangle) alongside text.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **"Sharp & Direct"**: Hover effects are simple color inversions (Black bg/White text -> White bg/Black text). No motion blur.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **"Mask and Reveal"**: Elements slide out from behind invisible masks. Very snappy timing.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: *Helvetica Now Display* or *Inter* (Tight tracking, Heavy weight).
    **Body/Data**: *Inter* or *Helvetica Now Text* (Normal weight, high legibility).
  </typography_system>
